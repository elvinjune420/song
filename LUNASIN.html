Do you think about me every night<br>
Before you go to sleep?<br>
I know you must be terrified<br>
Of what you might see in your dreams, but<br>

<p>
I'm here for you still<br>
And even if you don't think that I'm near<br>
I'll still be right next to you, my dear<br>
And the way you make me feel<br>
Has the power to make the whole world stand still<br>
Who's to say that our love ain't real?<br>

<p>
And I know I'm not the perfect guy<br>
But, I think I'm doing just alright<br>
It doesn't matter what you thought of me then<br>
But what you think of me now<br>
We haven't always seen eye to eye<br>
But right now, won't you look at mine?<br>
Don't be scared, there's no such thing as fear<br>
When you sleep, just know that<br>

<p>
I'm here for you still<br>
And even if you don't think that I'm near<br>
I'll still be right next to you, my dear<br>
And the way you make me feel<br>
Has the power to make the whole world stand still<br>
Who's to say that our love ain't real?<br>
